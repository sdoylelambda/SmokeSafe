      <p>
        With legal marijuana you may think that you are consuming a safe well
        regulated product, unfortuanitly this is not the case. From lead,
        mercury and other heavy metals too toxic fertilizers or even mold, you
        may be causing yourself more problems than you realize. Are goal is to
        create a unbiased record of such instances. Simular websites have a pay
        to play setup, where if a company pays enough money, they will have
        excellent reviews and show up first on the list. This is a very poor
        practice as it allows these giants to make millions by poisoning us. We
        are of course interested in potency, however the main priority is
        insureing we have 100% natuaral unadultarated products available and to
        force those who poison us to reconcider their business models.
